Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by keeping a history of modifications, enabling them to revert to previous versions if needed. Git helps manage different versions of a project through branches, which allow developers to work on features separately before merging them into the main codebase.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It enables developers to store, share, and collaborate on code more efficiently. GitHub offers tools like pull requests, which facilitate code reviews before merging changes, and issue tracking, which helps teams manage bugs and feature requests. It also integrates with various development and deployment tools, making it a central hub for DevOps workflows.

Together, Git and GitHub streamline software development by improving collaboration, ensuring code integrity, and providing a structured way to manage projects. Developers use them to contribute to open-source projects, work on team-based applications, and automate deployment pipelines. Whether working alone or in a team, Git and GitHub are essential tools for maintaining code quality and efficiency in modern software development.
