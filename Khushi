Git and GitHub are essential tools in modern software development, used for version control, collaboration, and code management. Here’s how they function:

Git:

A distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in code.
Allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
Enables branching, merging, and rollback to previous versions if needed.
Works locally on a developer’s machine but can connect to remote repositories.
GitHub:

A cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
Provides tools for team collaboration, such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.
Allows open-source and private projects to be shared and contributed to.
Integrates with CI/CD pipelines, project management tools, and other development workflows.
